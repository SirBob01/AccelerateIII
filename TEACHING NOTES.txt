WHEN DEMONSTRATING THE CODE:
- Divide the code into sections
	- Base it on the concepts that are needed to be taught at the moment
- Always demonstrate section-by-section, not line-by-line as you see in the final source code
	- This will help the audience familiarize themselves with the concepts
	- Information will be less cluttered, lower risk of information overload
- Always demonstrate code sections in this order:
	- Importing modules
	- Initializing pygame
	- Writing main() function
	- Creating display surface
	- Game loop
		- Events
		- Updating display
		- Framerate capping
	- Game objects
	- Game logic
	- Other rendering

GENERAL FLOW OF TEACHING:
- Introduce python and pygame and how you could make totes awesome things with it
	- AstroJumper as an example of my first pygame game
	- Centurion as an example of an awesome game

- Teach them how to write their first video game
	- First, make a program with pygame ("My first game!" as a caption, black screen)
		- Let them run this first as a gentle introduction into game development

	- Add events to make the background color change (adds interactivity)
	- Explain the following concepts, step by step:
		- Importing pygame
		- Main function
		- Display surface
			- Recap on variables and functions
		- Colors
			- Recap on tuples
		- Game loop
		- Events
		- Updating the display surface
		- Framerate capping

- Walk them through making their first actual game
	- Explain the following concepts as they go along the walkthrough:
		- Pixel coordinate system
		- Animation
		- Blitting
		- Bounding boxes
			- Position
			- Dimensions
			- Velocity
		- Making game objects that represent these ideas
	- Create a simple game where they avoid falling items
		- They can move the character with the arrow keys
		- They can shoot the objects to increase their score
		- They lose if they touch the falling object or if an object gets past the screen
		- The player MUST kill all the objects
	- Explain collision detection between bounding boxes

If there is extra time, add powerups to the game to make the player invunerable.
Remember to clarify misunderstood concepts and make sure that all of them are following along.
